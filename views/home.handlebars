<p class = "text">
 EVE Online is a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) based in space, developed by CCP Games in Reykjavik, Iceland.  It is filled with science fiction and stunning visuals and most of all, gratuitous spaceship battles.  It has a very devout fan base and is very friendly with third party development.  They make account information available through an API key that allows you to use various functions, such as character information, wallet balance, skill training queues, and industry job orders.  The default API key that EVE provides is an XML key, but there are 3rd party libraries that make it available on different languages.  We are going to be looking at the eveonlinejs library, that allows the key to be accessed using JavaScript and node.js.

In order for this tutorial to work, you need to have an active EVE online account.  If you would like, you can start a 14 day trial <a href = "https://secure.eveonline.com/trial/?invc=f9fb733b-e1f4-4dd7-8705-408c2b2c6c09&action=buddy">here</a>.  EVE does have a really high skill curve though, and new players often get frustrated with the game and give up, but if you start a trial and want to continue, i'd be happy to throw you some free ships and fly with you to get started.  Once you have a working account, go ahead and visit the <a href="https://community.eveonline.com/support/api-key/">API key management website</a> and create a key.  It helps to create a "full" access key, so select "all" in every category available and make sure its high lighted.  You can limit the amount of access you want, but unless someone gets your API key there are little to no security issues in selecting all.  Also make sure the no expiry box is selected, and you can name it whatever you'd like.  Once you have all the categories you want selected, hit submit, and you'll see the key in your list on the previous page.
