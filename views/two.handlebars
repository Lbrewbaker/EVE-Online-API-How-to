<h2> Step 2</h2> 
<p class = "text">
Now we are going to start getting into some coding. If you do not have an account, feel free to use my credentials on the first page. Open a new JavaScript file and start by setting it up to require the eveonlinejs library:

<xmp class = "codez">
	var eveApi = require('eveonlinejs')
</xmp>

You can now access functions built into the library using the <i class = "funcNames">eveApi</i> variable.  We are only going to cover how to use two functions built into the library <i class = "funcNames">setParams</i> and <i class = "funcNames">fetch</i>.
</p>

<p>
Next, we will have to set your keyID and vCode.  To do that, we are going to use the <i class = "funcNames">setParams()</i> function.  Substitute the values below with your keyID and vCode:
<xmp class = "codez">
	eveApi.setParams({
		keyID: '123456',
		vCode: 'hBjskljdF8JJjskjifsajkhlos29S9k2kmDDvXyJJ72io'
	});
</xmp>
Once you have all this set you're now officially ready to start making some function calls to access the API. You do not have to hard code values into the library this way, I am doing it simply for ease of use.
